Training and evaluating a model based on loan risk, using a dataset of historical lending actibity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. 

Created logistic aggression model. 

The results seemed to be accurate with a 99% accuracy therefore this model would be recommended for the company.
